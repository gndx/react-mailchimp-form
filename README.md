# react-mailchimp-form

It provides an easy-to configure component to add a mailchimp form to your react project

# Install

```npm
npm install react-mailchimp-form
```

Be sure to include the --save option to add this as a dependency in your application's package.json

# Usage

First you have to configure your Mailchimp account:

1. Create a new account or use an existing one
2. Add a new list or use an existing one
3. Personalize the fields on your list on "Settings > List Fields"
4. Copy the HTML and extract the action from "Signup Forms > Embedded forms"

The action URL will look like this ("YOUR-USER" may be "twitter" on certain accounts - just subsitute it with your username in this case):

```
https://<YOUR-USER>.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=XXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;id=XXXXXX
```

We will use this URL to configure the component, by adding it to the action prop of the component.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react"
// import the component
import Mailchimp from "react-mailchimp-form"

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Mailchimp
        action="https://<YOUR-USER>.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=XXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;id=XXXXXX"
        fields={[
          {
            name: "EMAIL",
            placeholder: "Email",
            type: "email",
            required: true,
          },
        ]}
      />
    )
  }
}

export default App
```

# Options

  //Adding multiple fields:
  fields={[
    {
      name: "EMAIL",
      placeholder: "Email",
      type: "email",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "FNAME",
      placeholder: "name",
      type: "text",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  // Change predetermined language
  messages={{
    sending: "Sending...",
    success: "Thank you for subscribing!",
    error: "An unexpected internal error has occurred.",
    empty: "You must write an e-mail.",
    duplicate: "Too many subscribe attempts for this email address",
    button: "Subscribe!",
